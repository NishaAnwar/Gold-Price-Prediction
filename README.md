**Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

This project predicts **gold prices** using a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on historical data and financial indicators. Key steps include **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, formatting dates, and analyzing correlations), **exploratory data analysis** (visualizing price distributions and feature relationships), and **model evaluation** to ensure accuracy. The model helps identify factors influencing gold prices and provides reliable price forecasts. ðŸš€
